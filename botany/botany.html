                    Like many great buildings on campus, Botany bay was built at the beginning of the 19th century. Botany Bay is a courtyard surrounding by the GMB, student accomidation and the Dining Hall. This magical spot is hidden in the ally's behind on each side of the GMB and in the center of the couryrad contains pitches that are used for multiple  sports too. For example, despite them being tennis courts these courts are used for 5 a side football, mens's hockey practice and tennis. The buildings in this courtyard have wonderfully preserved ivy latching onto the masonry making the courtyard a must see during spring!
                    Botany Bay also has cherry blossoms making it another reason to viist during Spring. The domrms in Botany Bay are a fan favourite with the student body blending a traditional exterior with a functional interior in addition to high ceilings and big windows and only having to share with one flatmate.
