                <p>History and Origin
                    Construction of the GMB (Graduates Memorial Building) began in 1892 and it officially opened in 1902.
                    The GMB was built as a visual symbol of Trinity College’s tercentenary—marking 300 years since its foundation in 1592.
                    The GMB stands on the site of an 18th-century Georgian red-brick structure known as the “Rotten Row”, which resembled the existing Rubrics.
                    Funding for the GMB came from Trinity graduates, which inspired its name.
                    It also serves as a memorial to Trinity graduates who died in war, beginning with the Boer War.
                </p>
                <p> The architet of the building was Sir Thomas Drew.</p>

                <b>Facade:</b>
      
                The Graduates Memorial Building (GMB) is a striking architectural structure comprising two residential halls flanking a central society hall and debating chamber. 
                This fifteen-bay, four-storey building, complete with attic accommodation, overlooks both Botany Bay and Parliament Square. It's facade, crafted from polished Irish 
                limestone, features central gable-fronts and is dominated by prominent ashlar limestone chimneys with carved string courses, as well as ornately carved limestone
                 urns. The GMB's walls are also constructed with the Irish ashlar limestone and additional Portland limestone composite pilasters adorned with foliate panels on the third-floor 
                 central bay. Stone carvings embellish the building further, 
                 including quoins, cornices, architrave and Corinthian pilastered quoins. The building’s windows are in the hald-dormer style and have with carved surrounds, 
                 elevated ground-floor windows and a circular oculus window on the front facade surrounded 
                 by egg-and-dart and scrollwork carvings. A Palladian window, consisting of a central arched section flanked by two rectangular ones, adorns the third floor. Window 
                 types vary and include 6-over-6, 4-over-4, 3-over-6, 6-over-9, and 1-over-1 timber sliding sashes, as well as a stained-glass window. Doorways are 
                 square-headed with carved Portland stone (limestone) shouldered architraves, broken pediments with ornate carved scrolls, urns and egg-and-dart cornices. The central entrance
                  is distinguished by a monogrammed carved keystone and timber panelled doors. An ornate granite staircase leads to the elevated main entrance of the building which 
                  houses the society rooms.
        </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Interior Layout:</b>
                The general arrangement of the building includes a grand Debating Chamber, designed as a double-height space to create ambient vocal setting. The key features of the chamber 
                include cornice mouldings with egg-and-dart patterned, rectangular plastered wall panels, a moulded dado rail, panelled composite pilasters and an eloborate carved timber 
                balcony that
                 overlooks the room. The main foyer of the societies building features a central carved timber staircase, which rises through the space and is illuminated by a stained glass
                  window depicting the Greek 
                 orators Epaminondas and Demosthenes. Additional rooms within the building include billiard rooms, a library, a records room, and conversation rooms, all of which are finished
                  with plaster ceiling panels, cornices, and dado rails. Throughout the interior, there is consistent use of timber panelled doors and timber architraves, contributing to the 
                  building’s refined and cohesive aesthetic. The accomidation is in the standard student layout including shared kitchens and individual bedrooms with optional ensuit 
                  bathrooms decorated with interior room mouldings.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Rooms and Functions:</b>
                The GMB was originally built solely to host society meetings and functions, with the ground floor housing the Debating Chamber—a high-ceilinged space featuring a 
                carved balcony and Ionic-style pilasters adorning the surrounding interior walls (see photo of Debating Chamber). To provide access to the chamber and other society rooms, 
                the building includes a central foyer with a large wooden staircase spiraling vertically from the ground floor to the second floor. Today, the GMB contains the Debating Chamber, 
                the Phil and Hist Conversation Rooms—which serve as common areas—as well as a Pool and Recreation Room. Although its use has expanded, the GMB continues to serve 
                its original purpose, functioning as a residential building for students and a venue for a wide range of societies, from the Pool Society and Caledonian
                 Society to the university's historic debating societies.

            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Victorian Gothic Revival:</b>
                The building was primarily created using Victorian Gothic Revival principles, a style characterized by pointed arches, steep gables, detailed stonework and
                 a strong vertical emphasis. Decorative elements like carved limestone finials, urns, pilasters, and marigold motifs reflect this aesthetic in the GMB's exterior architecture. 
                 The use of contrast between stone textures and elaborate ornamentation helps give the GMB its rich, historic character while aligning it visually with older structures like the 
                 nearby Rubrics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>Sir Thomas Drew: </b>
            The GMB was designed by Sir Thomas Drew, a leading architect of his time and the successful entrant in the 1899 design competition. 
                Despite the building’s age, it has been sympathetically modernized, ensuring that its architectural details and historic identity have been preserved. 
                Today, it remains not only a functional part of Trinity College’s infrastructure but also a landmark of academic heritage and architectural excellence. Other projects Sir Thomas Drew was 
                responsible for include the restoriation projects on St Patricks Cathedral and Christ Church Cathedral aswell as most significantly being the architect of St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast completed in 1899.
            </p>

                <br>
                <p>  <b> Stained Glass Window: </b>
          The central staircase is lit by a stained glass window depicting Greek orators Epaminondas and Demosthenes.
                These windows enhance the building's atmosphere and classical associations. The stained glass window is around 2m high, 1m wide and located in the middle 
                between the ground and 1st floor. The window attracts attention by illuminates the wall as well as the staircase and 
                ground floor with vibrant colours.
                The window was comissioned in honour of a student who passed away during the 2nd Boer War in South Africa.

                    The GMB at Trinity College Dublin is constructed using a combination of traditional
                    and modern materials, reflecting both its style within the Victorian Gothic revival style. The primary
                    materials include:
                </p>
                <ol class="material-list">
                    <li><strong>Granite</strong> – A construction material that is durable and locally sourced stone. Granite was used on the stairs and gave the them the
                        distinctive appearance compared to the rest of the building.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Limestone</strong>–    The primary construction material, giving the building its
                        distinctive appearance. Irish ashlar Limestone was chosen because it is a smooth stone, fine-grained and ideal for precise carvings and other decorative ornamentation that enhances the building's neo-Gothic aestetic. 
                        Additionally, Irish limestone was widely used in historic buildings for it's strength and availability. Limestone isnt used as often in Irish 19th century architecture because of how expensive it was for
                    building construction compared to brick</li>
                    <li><strong>Slate Roof</strong> – The roof is covered with slate tiles, which were commonly sourced
                        from Irish quarries. Slate provides weather resistance and longevity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timber</strong> – Used extensively in the interior for the flooring, the doors and the staircases. Oak and pine were commonly used because they offered durability and stability.</li>
                   
                </ol>
                <p class="conclusion">
                    These materials were chosen for their aestetic qualities strength and ability to withstand Ireland’s
                    damp climate, ensuring the GMB' future long-term preservation.
