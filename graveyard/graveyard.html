                <p>Chaloner's Corner was built in 1699 and is the smallest graveyard in Ireland. The graveyard was named after Dr. Luke Chaloner who was one of the founders of Trinity and our first ever Provost. The small graveyard small graveyard is nested between the laundrette and Dining Hall. Chaloner's Corner is also the site of the original chapel in Trinity (where Luke Chaloner was buried) and is why his tomb is located outside the chapel in such an obsqure spot.
