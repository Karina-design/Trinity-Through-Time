                <p>"Rubrics" buildings typically refer to historic red-brick structures located at Trinity College
                    Dublin, Ireland. Built in the 17th century, these buildings are some of the oldest surviving
                    structures on campus. They were originally used as student accommodation and administrative offices.
                    The Rubrics are characterized by their Georgian architectural style, symmetrical design, and
                    distinctive red-brick facade. Over time, they have been carefully preserved and modernized while
                    maintaining their historical significance.
                </p>
                <p>The Rubrics at Trinity College Dublin is a historic red-brick building dating back to the late 17th
                    century, making it one of the oldest surviving structures on campus. It is a four-story, rectangular
                    building with a symmetrical Georgian-style design. Originally built as student accommodation, it
                    features narrow staircases, evenly spaced sash windows, and rooms arranged along corridors. The
                    building faces New Square and overlooks Library Square, contributing to the historic charm of the
                    college. Over the years, it has been carefully preserved and modernized while retaining its
                    architectural heritage.</p>

            <p>
                <b>Structure & Design:</b>
                The building consists of a single, elongated block divided into sections.
                It features a Georgian-style symmetrical facade with evenly spaced sash windows.
                The red-brick exterior gives it a distinct historical character.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Entrances & Staircases:</b>
                The main entrances are located at intervals along the facade, leading to staircases that provide access
                to the upper floors.
                The stairwells are narrow, reflecting the building’s historical construction.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Rooms & Interiors:</b>
                Originally built as student accommodation, the rooms are arranged along corridors with windows facing
                both the front and rear of the building.
                The ground floor has larger rooms, possibly used for common areas or administrative purposes in later
                years.
                The upper floors primarily consist of small study bedrooms or offices.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Courtyard & Surroundings:</b>
                The Rubrics faces New Square, an open grassy area within the college.
                To the rear, it overlooks Library Square, another historic part of the campus.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Despite its age, the building has been modernized while preserving its historical integrity, and it
                continues to serve as an important part of Trinity College's heritage..</p>

                <p class="intro">
                    The Geography Building at Trinity College Dublin is constructed using a combination of traditional
                    and modern materials, reflecting both its historical setting and functional purpose. The primary
                    materials include:
                </p>
                <ol class="material-list">
                    <li><strong>Red Brick</strong> – The primary construction material, giving the building its
                        distinctive appearance. These bricks were likely handmade and fired using local clay, a common
                        practice in 17th-century Dublin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limestone</strong>– Used for structural elements such as window sills, door surrounds,
                        and foundation reinforcements. Irish limestone was widely used in historic buildings for its
                        strength and availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slate Roof</strong> – The roof is covered with slate tiles, which were commonly sourced
                        from Irish quarries. Slate provides weather resistance and longevity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timber</strong> – Used extensively in the interior for flooring, staircases, doors, and
                        roof structures. Oak and pine were commonly used, offering durability and stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrought Iron</strong>– Found in some decorative elements, such as railings and window
                        fastenings, adding both function and ornamentation.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="conclusion">
                    These materials were chosen for their strength, availability, and ability to withstand Ireland’s
                    damp climate, ensuring the Rubrics' long-term preservation.
